# We are going to implement a very helpful function, called group.
#
# group takes a list of things and returns a list of group, where each group is formed by
# all equal consecutive elements in the list.
# For example:
# group([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]) == [[1, 1, 1], [2], [3], [1, 1]]
# group([1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3]) == [[1], [2], [1], [2], [3, 3]]
